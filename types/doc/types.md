# User Defined Data Types

This section discusses techniques working with Go user defined data and function types.

## Interfaces

A Golang interface is a custom type for specifying a set of methods. There are several ways of implementing a type that fulfil a given interface.

Working xxamples demonstrating the various implementations are found here [./example/types/interf/](../examples/interf/).

## Struct types
 
<u>Embedded struct</u>

You can embed a struct within a struct. Here is a [working example](../examples/embed/embedded_test.go)
